Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

# Redesign From First Principles

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from the start.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference: types, docs, examples, rationale sections
- Think about the whole redesign, then deliver it incrementally

This is the method for preserving option value when integrating changes into an existing design.
