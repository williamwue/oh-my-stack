# Reflect

## Codex delegation binding

For every delegated worker in this workflow, derive the exact `model`,
`reasoning_effort`, and complete role-plus-task `message` with
`../../scripts/codex-delegation.mjs prepare` relative to this Skill. Supply the active
resolution manifest and named route/panel entry where configured; otherwise
supply the canonical role and the observed parent model and effort. Pass
the returned `task_name`, `fork_turns=none`, model, effort, and message
explicitly to the spawn call. Do not use a generated custom-role name as a selector or
claim its TOML was activated. After the worker finishes, run the helper's
`verify` mode on the persisted parent and child records when available; it
checks the spawn metadata, parent link, and child `turn_context`.
The persisted spawn message may be encrypted; disclose when its exact
role/task text cannot be audited. If records are unavailable, state that
runtime model resolution is unverified.

Use only when the user asks to reflect on an actual conversation or work run.
Trivial exchanges and one-off preferences do not justify durable Skill edits.
Identify the active task transcript through the runtime's task history or the
workspace-scoped transcript path. Do not search unrelated projects or private
history. When no full transcript is accessible, create a bounded digest from
visible context and disclose the loss of tool evidence.

Run three independent read-only reviews when delegation is available: judgment
(wrong decisions and missed evidence), tooling (friction and repeatable checks),
and divergent alternatives. Give each the same frozen task record and require
precise citations, counterexamples, and proposed destination. When available,
use `reflect.tooling` for tooling and `reflect.judgment` for judgment and the
divergent lens; keep all three sessions independent. Use configured routes,
not assumed model identities. With fewer workers, preserve separate
lenses and label reduced independence.

Synthesize Accepted, Rejected, and Backlog findings. Root rechecks each accepted
claim against the transcript and target Skill. Move a finding to Backlog when
a type, schema, lint rule, test, or runtime check enforces it more reliably than
prose. Reject duplicated guidance, subjective one-offs, and changes outside the
user's workspace or intended scope.

Show the proposed edit set with exact paths and the evidence before altering
shared or personal Skills. Apply only changes the user requested or approved;
otherwise return a reviewable proposal. For approved changes, use
[authoring-a-skill](../authoring-a-skill/SKILL.md), validate references and
frontmatter, and test behavioral changes when warranted. Do not assume a team
tracker exists or file external backlog items without authorization. Return
applied edits, proposed edits, rejected findings, and open structural work.
