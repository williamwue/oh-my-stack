## Codex delegation binding

For every delegated worker in this workflow, derive the exact `model`,
`reasoning_effort`, and complete role-plus-task `message` with
`../../scripts/codex-delegation.mjs prepare` relative to this Skill. It resolves
the nearest project manifest first, then the user manifest. Supply the named
route/panel entry where configured; otherwise supply the canonical role
and the observed parent model and effort. For task adjustment, supply
`--job-context JOB.json` with `kind` hardest, judgment, routine, or verification
and optional boolean `urgent`, plus `--inventory INVENTORY.json` for observed
effort alternatives. The saved model stays fixed. Without inventory only
the saved effort is available. Read `audit.taskSelection` before dispatch.
Keep the complete prepared request. If the host rejects its adjustment,
supply `--rejected-adjustment ERROR.json` and
`--rejected-prepared-request REQUEST.json` to retry the original role line
even after the inventory changes. A request checksum binds the receipt;
the host remains responsible for authenticating the rejection evidence.
Pass
the returned `task_name`, `fork_turns=none`, model, effort, and message
explicitly to the spawn call. Do not use a generated custom-role name as a selector or
claim its TOML was activated. After the worker finishes, run the helper's
`verify` mode on the persisted parent and child records when available; it
checks the spawn metadata, parent link, and child `turn_context`.
The persisted spawn message may be encrypted; disclose when its exact
role/task text cannot be audited. If records are unavailable, state that
runtime model resolution is unverified.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `../poteto-mode/scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

### Autopilot-stack

**You own the stack, never the landing. Hand the operator one linear stack of base-chained PRs to review and land.** **Autopilot-full** holds except for how verified work leaves. Each tick re-reads both playbooks from trunk, and this one wins where they differ.

1. **Run Autopilot-full's owners, minus the landing.** Owners report STACK-READY in place of merge-ready. They never rebase onto another branch, trunk included, and never retarget, merge, close a PR, or arm auto-merge, because the root owns the chain's topology and the operator owns the landing. When an item depends on another, its owner branches from that item's branch, not from trunk.
2. **Give the topology one writer.** Owners push only their own branches and report each tip and its intended parent. Only you rebase or retarget a link, because two writers on one chain undo each other. Append each clean PR in dependency order, with its base set to its parent's branch (`origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`). Never require `gt`. An owner takes your push as its new base and lease, and on a conflict resolves its own slice for you to push.
3. **Absorb drift at the root.** Until landing starts, apply Autopilot-full step 5's test to each link and rebase the chain bottom-up where it calls for one. Then apply the patch-id rule link by link, since a link's base is its parent.
4. **Deliver the chain, then keep your hands off it.** Each link carries its verdict in its PR. Once landing starts, nobody writes to the chain except the post-merge retarget that `playbooks/shipping.md` sanctions, because a second writer breaks a landing in flight. A mid-landing problem goes through you to the operator, and any fix waits for the operator's go.

**Choosing between the autopilots.** Autopilot-full when the PRs are independent and landing authority is granted. Autopilot-stack when the operator wants review before landing, the work is sequenced or coupled, or merge authority is withheld.

**Reply:** catch the operator up per the **ketchup** skill, with links to the stack root and tip, a one-line verdict per link, and anything parked or excluded with the reason.
