## Codex delegation binding

For every delegated worker in this workflow, derive the exact `model`,
`reasoning_effort`, and complete role-plus-task `message` with
`../../scripts/codex-delegation.mjs prepare` relative to this Skill. It resolves
the nearest project manifest first, then the user manifest. Supply the named
route/panel entry where configured; otherwise supply the canonical role
and the observed parent model and effort. For task adjustment, supply
`--job-context JOB.json` with `kind` hardest, judgment, routine, or verification
and optional boolean `urgent`, plus `--inventory INVENTORY.json` for observed
effort alternatives. The saved model stays fixed. Without inventory only
the saved effort is available. Read `audit.taskSelection` before dispatch.
Keep the complete prepared request. If the host rejects its adjustment,
supply `--rejected-adjustment ERROR.json` and
`--rejected-prepared-request REQUEST.json` to retry the original role line
even after the inventory changes. A request checksum binds the receipt;
the host remains responsible for authenticating the rejection evidence.
Pass
the returned `task_name`, `fork_turns=none`, model, effort, and message
explicitly to the spawn call. Do not use a generated custom-role name as a selector or
claim its TOML was activated. After the worker finishes, run the helper's
`verify` mode on the persisted parent and child records when available; it
checks the spawn metadata, parent link, and child `turn_context`.
The persisted spawn message may be encrypted; disclose when its exact
role/task text cannot be audited. If records are unavailable, state that
runtime model resolution is unverified.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

# Recall

**Before you start or resume work, you rebuild the user's recent working context and hand back a tight capsule of where things stand now and what to do next.**

Keep it tight and on-topic. Read only what the in-scope threads need, then stop.

Your context lives in two records. Your own chat history holds what you did and decided. The shared record holds everything that happened around the same code under other names: the symptoms users keep reporting, the fixes that shipped and got reverted, the errors still firing in prod. That second record is what the **why** skill searches, across source control, the issue tracker, chat and issue channels, long-form docs, and error tracking. A feature with a long bug tail keeps most of its story there, so don't reconstruct it from your transcripts alone.

Transcripts live at `the active workspace transcript path supplied by the generated runtime binding`, using the host-provided transcript format. Inspect that format before parsing; unavailable transcripts remain an evidence gap.

1. Classify, then route. One specific prior chat to resume is the `session-pickup` playbook, not this. Turning habits into a durable skill is `automate-me`. A human-readable summary of your work is a different task. Recall loads working context across recent chats before you act. If the user already gave you a full state capsule (paths, branch, the change), use it and skip the mining.
2. Lock the scope before searching. Pin the window ("recent" is a real range, default the last 7 days), the topic if named, and the workspace (default the active one. Never read another project's transcripts without being asked). State the scope back. Never quietly turn "all" into "recent N".
3. Fan out across your chat history. Spawn parallel subagents on a fast, cheap model, each taking a slice of the corpus. Tell every subagent to order candidates by real modification time (`ls -t`) and never by UUID name, grep the topic first and then read only the matching chats and only their relevant regions, and skip the current chat plus obvious noise (subagent, eval, and test chats). Each returns the same schema, one block per chat: topic, the user's goal, decisions, open threads, struggles and corrections, and artifacts (PRs, tickets, branches), each citing the chat UUID. For one or two chats, skip the fan-out and search directly. The raw transcripts stay in the subagents. The main thread gets only their findings. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Sweep the shared record whenever the topic names a feature, file, subsystem, area, or bug. This is the default, not a judgment call, and "my work on X" does not exempt it. Hand it to the **why** skill's source investigators, but steer their question from "why was this built this way" to "what's the current state, what's been tried and didn't hold, and what are users still reporting". Reuse its per-source playbooks, run the investigators in parallel with the chat-history mining, and inherit its posture: one investigator per source, null results are findings, skip an unavailable MCP and say so. Fold what comes back into the brief. Skip this step only for pure activity recall with no named target ("what did I do this week"), where your own history and live state are the entire answer.
5. Verify against live state. Take the PRs, branches, and tickets that the mining and the sweep surfaced and check them with `git` and `gh`. When the answer hinges on what an agent actually did (the tools it ran, files it read, errors it hit), read the full transcript, not just a trimmed local copy.
6. Write the brief to the contract below. Group by thread. Stay on the named topic.

Before a negative claim that an item was never recorded, search every record location named by the project's standing instructions within the stated workspace and time scope. If a designated record is unavailable, report that gap and qualify the absence claim. For human rulings, use [Claims about human decisions](../why/references/epistemics.md#claims-about-human-decisions). Keep original wording and source separate from copied agent summaries. This preserves provenance and does not add a consent gate.

## Output contract

Lead with the capsule, then the thread status, then the problems, then the next move. Deeper detail goes below or gets cut.

- **Capsule.** At most 5 bullets. What this work is and where it stands overall.
- **Threads.** One line each, prefixed with exactly one status tag: `[merged #N]`, `[open PR #N]`, `[in flight <branch>]`, `[verified, uncommitted]`, `[reverted #N]`, or `[planned, not started]`. A thread with no tag is not done yet, so tag it.
- **Problems.** At most 5, the recurring ones. Include the symptoms users keep reporting and any fix that shipped and was reverted, so the next attempt starts where the last one failed.
- **Next move.** The single most useful next action, concrete.

An adjacent feature or ticket stays out unless it blocks this one. When the capsule and thread lines outgrow a screen, cut detail before you cut threads. Write the brief through the **unslop** skill, cite chat findings by UUID and shared-record findings by their source (PR #, ticket ID, chat permalink, error-tracker issue), and sanitize private context before any public output.

**Reply:** the brief, to the contract above.
