## OMP model routing

At the start of this workflow, run `../../scripts/model-resolution.mjs`
with `--runtime omp --cwd` set to the current workspace. Read the returned
manifest: nearest project first, then the user's `~/.omp/agent/` default.
For each configured route, select its named agent through OMP's native
task-agent selector and verify that its source matches the chosen scope;
for a canonical role, use the manifest role's `agent` name (user
defaults use namespaced `ohmystack-role-*` agents).
Preserve panel entry order and count. If no mapping is present, retain the
workflow's normal runtime model. Verify resolved worker model and thinking
level from OMP session/job metadata, not from the role file alone.
When `task` returns a background job id, retain it until terminal status.
On OMP hosts exposing `proc://` (observed in 18.3.0), use `read proc://<id>`
for non-consuming status, `wait` to drain, and `write proc://<id>/kill`
to cancel an owned job with the required approval. Confirm cancellation
before replacing a worker and reject results from older generations.
Do not assume the deprecated `hub` tool exists. If safe cancellation
is unavailable, wait or report the unit incomplete; never silently
treat an unconfirmed worker as cancelled.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Every spawn is a native child with the bounded role from the generated runtime binding and read-only workspace authority. Explorers use the `how explorer` line in the `effective host model resolution` rule (default `observed code-model choice`), and every explainer uses the `how explainer` line (default `observed judgment-model choice`). Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If the host rejects a configured model, reconcile it against the current inventory and generated model selection guide. Use only an observed, authorized replacement and disclose it; never guess a slug. Alias entries inherit the parent model and are not rejected real model names. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.

## 1. Assess complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. Spawn one explainer that explores and explains in one pass, built from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to step 4.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): go to step 2.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## 2. Explore (complex only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers in a single message, each with `references/explorer-prompt.md` and its angle filled in.

## 3. Synthesize (complex only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one explainer with `references/explainer-prompt.md` and every explorer's findings filled in.

## 4. Present

Present the explainer's output. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
