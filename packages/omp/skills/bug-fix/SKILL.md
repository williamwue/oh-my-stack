## OMP model routing

At the start of this workflow, run `../../scripts/model-resolution.mjs`
with `--runtime omp --cwd` set to the current workspace. Read the returned
manifest: nearest project first, then the user's `~/.omp/agent/` default.
For each configured route, select its named agent through OMP's native
task-agent selector and verify that its source matches the chosen scope;
for a canonical role, use the manifest role's `agent` name (user
defaults use namespaced `ohmystack-role-*` agents).
Preserve panel entry order and count. If no mapping is present, retain the
workflow's normal runtime model. Verify resolved worker model and thinking
level from OMP session/job metadata, not from the role file alone.
When `task` returns a background job id, retain it until terminal status.
On OMP hosts exposing `proc://` (observed in 18.3.0), use `read proc://<id>`
for non-consuming status, `wait` to drain, and `write proc://<id>/kill`
to cancel an owned job with the required approval. Confirm cancellation
before replacing a worker and reject results from older generations.
Do not assume the deprecated `hub` tool exists. If safe cancellation
is unavailable, wait or report the unit incomplete; never silently
treat an unconfirmed worker as cancelled.
For this workflow's implementers use `code.bug-fix`.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `../poteto-mode/scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

### Bug fix

**You own this task. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate investigation and the fix to subagents, stay in the lead.

Be scientific. Every shipped line traces to runtime evidence. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" is a hypothesis, not a fix. It does not ship. When evidence refutes a hypothesis, revert what it motivated. The smallest change the evidence justifies ships, nothing more.

1. Reproduce it yourself on the matching surface via the control skill (Non-negotiables), even when a debug or instrumentation protocol says to ask the user to reproduce. Ask the user only with a stated, specific reason the control surface cannot reach the target, and only after driving it as far as it goes. If it won't reproduce directly, synthesize the trigger, tighten conditions, or instrument until it fires.
2. Binary-search the cause. Form the candidate hypotheses, then rule them out until one survives. Seed them with `how` over the affected subsystem and the **why** skill for regression history. Each pass, take the split that cuts the most remaining problem space, get runtime evidence, eliminate. When program state is unclear, add instrumentation or logging and read it as the code runs. Don't guess. Drive a long or stubborn hunt with the source host's `/loop` command. Confirm the surviving *mechanism* with runtime evidence before the step-3 architect/interrogate fan-out.
3. Plan the fix. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation to a subagent using your configured bug-fix model (default `observed code-model choice`) with a specific scope.
4. Verify on the same surface. The original repro now passes. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it. Unit tests show branch behavior, not bug absence.
5. Stage the commits so the failing repro lands before the fix in git history. See the **tdd** skill for the failing-test-first cadence when the bug has a cheap local test path. Skip it when the test would be expensive, integration-heavy, or unclear.
   This is the canonical **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, the failing test first and the fix on top.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.

**Reply:** what was broken, root cause, fix, how you verified. Paste failing-then-passing repro output verbatim.
