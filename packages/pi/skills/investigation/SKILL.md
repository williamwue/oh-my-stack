## Pi native binding

Read [the native binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) and
[model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md). Use `oms_delegate` with
`start`, `collect`, and `cancel` for the workflow's explicitly requested
route/member. Saved Pi resolution and packaged role contracts select
the child model, thinking level, and permissions. Preserve panel order and
count. Supply explicit context and an isolated checkout for writing roles.
Report actual model and effort separately from requested configuration.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `../poteto-mode/scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

### Investigation

**You own the answer. Plan, route, write.**

Investigation requests are read-only. They produce a cited explanation or a recommendation, not a code change.

1. Route through the **how** skill. For motivation questions, also route through the **why** skill.
2. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only investigation`.
3. Produce the `how`-shaped output (Overview / Key Concepts / How It Works / Where Things Live / Gotchas), or a recommendation with a tradeoffs table if the request is a decision between alternatives.
4. Apply the **unslop** skill to the reply.

No PR, no babysit, no `architect` unless the investigation precedes a code change. If it does, hand back to the user and re-route to Bug fix or Feature.

**Reply:** the investigation output. For "are we sure?" answers, include your real judgment with reasons. Push back if the premise is wrong (see Autonomy).
