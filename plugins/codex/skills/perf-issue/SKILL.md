## Codex delegation binding

For every delegated worker in this workflow, derive the exact `model`,
`reasoning_effort`, and complete role-plus-task `message` with
`../../scripts/codex-delegation.mjs prepare` relative to this Skill. It resolves
the nearest project manifest first, then the user manifest. Supply the named
route/panel entry where configured; otherwise supply the canonical role
and the observed parent model and effort. For task adjustment, supply
`--job-context JOB.json` with `kind` hardest, judgment, routine, or verification
and optional boolean `urgent`, plus `--inventory INVENTORY.json` for observed
effort alternatives. The saved model stays fixed. Without inventory only
the saved effort is available. Read `audit.taskSelection` before dispatch.
Keep the complete prepared request. If the host rejects its adjustment,
supply `--rejected-adjustment ERROR.json` and
`--rejected-prepared-request REQUEST.json` to retry the original role line
even after the inventory changes. A request checksum binds the receipt;
the host remains responsible for authenticating the rejection evidence.
Pass
the returned `task_name`, `fork_turns=none`, model, effort, and message
explicitly to the spawn call. Do not use a generated custom-role name as a selector or
claim its TOML was activated. After the worker finishes, run the helper's
`verify` mode on the persisted parent and child records when available; it
checks the spawn metadata, parent link, and child `turn_context`.
The persisted spawn message may be encrypted; disclose when its exact
role/task text cannot be audited. If records are unavailable, state that
runtime model resolution is unverified.
For this workflow's implementers use `code.perf-issue`.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `../poteto-mode/scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

### Perf issue

**You own the measurement story. Plan, review, verify the numbers.** Tie every fix to a measurement, don't read source instead of measuring.

1. Capture a baseline trace via the matching control skill. Vet the baseline, and each later number, with the **benchmark-checklist** skill.
2. `how` to ground hypotheses. Don't claim a perf ceiling without running it first.
   Try the performance mantras in order, cheapest first:
   1. Don't do it. Stop work whose result nothing uses rather than cheapening it.
   2. Do it, but don't do it again.
   3. Do it less.
   4. Do it later.
   5. Do it when they're not looking.
   6. Do it concurrently.
   7. Do it cheaper.

   When an earlier mantra meets the target, stop.
3. Plan the fix from the trace. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation to a subagent using your configured perf-issue model (default `observed code-model choice`). Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section. Review the diff. Capture a post-fix trace.
   Apply the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each attempt before trying the next.
4. Parse and compare the artifacts (JSON to sqlite, diff). "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
5. Cite the measurement in the PR.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.

For sustained improvement against a metric rather than a one-off fix, use the Hillclimb playbook (`playbooks/hillclimb.md`).

**Reply:** baseline number, post-fix number, delta, artifact path.
