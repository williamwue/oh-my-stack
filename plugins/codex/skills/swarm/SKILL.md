## Codex delegation binding

For every delegated worker in this workflow, derive the exact `model`,
`reasoning_effort`, and complete role-plus-task `message` with
`../../scripts/codex-delegation.mjs prepare` relative to this Skill. It resolves
the nearest project manifest first, then the user manifest. Supply the named
route/panel entry where configured; otherwise supply the canonical role
and the observed parent model and effort. For task adjustment, supply
`--job-context JOB.json` with `kind` hardest, judgment, routine, or verification
and optional boolean `urgent`, plus `--inventory INVENTORY.json` for observed
effort alternatives. The saved model stays fixed. Without inventory only
the saved effort is available. Read `audit.taskSelection` before dispatch.
Keep the complete prepared request. If the host rejects its adjustment,
supply `--rejected-adjustment ERROR.json` and
`--rejected-prepared-request REQUEST.json` to retry the original role line
even after the inventory changes. A request checksum binds the receipt;
the host remains responsible for authenticating the rejection evidence.
Pass
the returned `task_name`, `fork_turns=none`, model, effort, and message
explicitly to the spawn call. Do not use a generated custom-role name as a selector or
claim its TOML was activated. After the worker finishes, run the helper's
`verify` mode on the persisted parent and child records when available; it
checks the spawn metadata, parent link, and child `turn_context`.
The persisted spawn message may be encrypted; disclose when its exact
role/task text cannot be audited. If records are unavailable, state that
runtime model resolution is unverified.

Host adaptation. Read the installed package's [runtime binding](../../docs/runtime-binding.md) for delegation, tools, paths, transcript access, and control surfaces, and [model selection](../../docs/model-selection.md) for the named routes and ordered panels below. These bindings translate host calls; they add no workflow stages. Continue already authorized implementation through its checks. Advice-only requests end with advice. Publication, merge, deployment, billable requests, credential access, and user-scope configuration retain the host and project authorization gates. A workflow step naming one of these actions does not grant that authority. Source-host helpers under `scripts/` are reference-only unless the generated binding identifies supported execution for that exact helper; use the documented native helper only for the capability it supports. Report unavailable capabilities and verification separately.

# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `the effective host model resolution`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `observed code-model choice`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If the host rejects a configured model, reconcile it against the current inventory and generated model selection guide. Use only an observed, authorized replacement and disclose it; never guess a slug. Alias entries inherit the parent model and are not rejected real model names. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with the bounded role from the generated runtime binding, an independent remote checkout where the host supports it, background execution through the generated runtime binding, and the step 4 model, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Use a local isolated checkout only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass the explicit base branch in the native workspace binding.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
